# Jawa!
Jawa! is a URL shorter that supports both anonymous and authenticated users.
Inspired by [Theo's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcyEtvSiM9c), and used his base repo as a starting point.

## Used Technologies
- TypeScript
- Next.js for client and server rendering

I am kinda learning Next.JS, Typescript and Prisma technologies for my next projects. So, I am open to any reviews, sugesstions, comments.
